      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> I’m a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Missouri – Columbia with a deep interest in how technology can solve real-world problems. That curiosity has led me to continually learn, build, and collaborate — both in and out of the classroom.
          <br><br>
          During my time at university I built a strong foundation in programming, logical thinking, and problem solving, but it was during my internships that the concepts I've learned really came to life. At Gainwell Technologies, I worked 
          on production-ready solutions using C#, SQL, JavaScript, and other technologies, building upon existing systems to streamline internal processes and improve efficiency. Whether I was developing UI widgets for real-time event monitoring or automating email notifications for 
          data requests, each project taught me something new and pushed me to grow. 
          <br><br>
          Outside of work, I enjoy experimenting with new ideas and collaborating with peers. One of my favorite personal projects was learning to build an e-commerce clothing web application from scratch using ASP.NET, which helped sharpen 
          my full-stack development and database skills. Another highlight was my Capstone project where my team and I designed and built a 3D-printed robot capable of recreating designs in sand, powered by a Swift mobile app.
          I see every project as an opportunity to grow, make connections, and make an impact. I enjoy being part of a team, learning from those around me, and contributing my own perspective to build meaningful solutions. Whether I’m working on scalable systems or exploring new frameworks, 
          I bring a mix of curiosity, focus, and energy to the table. 
          <br><br>
          When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me reading up on emerging tech, practicing martial arts, or spending time outdoors. I’m excited about where this journey is headed and am always open to new opportunities to learn and contribute.
          <br><br>
          <b>Let’s build something great together.</b>
